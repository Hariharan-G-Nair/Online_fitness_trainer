Strength Training,Focuses on maximal force production by recruiting high-threshold motor units. Uses heavy loads and low repetitions to improve neural efficiency and absolute strength.,Caloric Surplus or Maintenance,200–400 kcal surplus (optional),2–5 minutes,"Valsalva maneuver during lifts, controlled exhale at lockout","Low reps, heavy loads, long rest to maximize force output"
Hypertrophy Training,"Aims to increase muscle fiber size through mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage.",Caloric Surplus,250–500 kcal surplus,45–90 seconds,"Controlled breathing, exhale during concentric phase","Moderate reps, high volume, shorter rest"
Muscular Endurance,Improves the muscle’s ability to sustain repeated contractions over time with minimal fatigue.,Maintenance or Slight Deficit,0 to -300 kcal,30–60 seconds,Rhythmic breathing matched to reps,"High reps, light loads, short rest"
Power Training,Develops the ability to generate force quickly by combining strength and speed.,Maintenance or Slight Surplus,0–300 kcal surplus,2–4 minutes,"Sharp inhale before lift, explosive exhale","Low reps, explosive intent, full recovery"
Fat Loss Training,Maximizes calorie expenditure and metabolic stress to promote fat oxidation.,Caloric Deficit,-300 to -600 kcal,20–60 seconds,Fast controlled breathing to sustain intensity,"Circuits, HIIT, minimal rest"
Athletic Performance,"Enhances agility, coordination, speed, and sport-specific movement patterns.",Maintenance or Slight Surplus,0–300 kcal surplus,90–180 seconds,Sport-rhythm breathing,Multi-planar explosive movements
Functional Training,Improves real-life movement efficiency by training multiple joints and planes together.,Maintenance,0 kcal,45–90 seconds,Natural breathing with movement flow,"Compound, balance-based exercises"
Calisthenics,Builds relative strength and body control using bodyweight resistance.,Maintenance or Slight Surplus,0–250 kcal surplus,60–120 seconds,Controlled inhale/exhale per movement,Leverage-based progression
HIIT,Alternates short bursts of maximal effort with brief recovery to improve cardiovascular and metabolic conditioning.,Caloric Deficit,-300 to -500 kcal,Work:Rest based (1:1 or 2:1),Rapid nasal or mouth breathing,"High intensity, short duration"
Rehabilitation Training,"Restores movement patterns, strength, and joint stability after injury.",Maintenance,0 kcal,30–60 seconds,Slow diaphragmatic breathing,"Controlled tempo, low intensity"
